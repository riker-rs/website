# Multi-type Messaging

In real world applications, actors will typically receive different message types and execute different behaviors based on the type received.

So far you've seen a simple example where an actor's message type is defined in the `Actor::Msg` associated type. More specifically, this defines an actor's mailbox type. To allow an actor to receive multiple message types, Riker provides a `Receive<T>` trait and the `#[actor]` attribute.

Let's see how these are used:

```rust
use riker::actors::*;

use riker::system::ActorSystem;
use std::time::Duration;

// Define the messages we'll use
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct Add;

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct Sub;

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct Print;

// Define the Actor and use the 'actor' attribute
// to specify which messages it will receive
#[actor(Add, Sub, Print)]
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    count: u32,
}

impl Actor for Counter {
    // we used the #[actor] attribute so CounterMsg is the Msg type
    type Msg = CounterMsg;

    fn recv(&mut self, ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>, msg: Self::Msg, sender: Sender) {
        // Use the respective Receive<T> implementation
        self.receive(ctx, msg, sender);
    }
}

impl Receive<Add> for Counter {
    type Msg = CounterMsg;

    fn receive(&mut self, _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>, _msg: Add, _sender: Sender) {
        self.count += 1;
    }
}

impl Receive<Sub> for Counter {
    type Msg = CounterMsg;

    fn receive(&mut self, _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>, _msg: Sub, _sender: Sender) {
        self.count -= 1;
    }
}

impl Receive<Print> for Counter {
    type Msg = CounterMsg;

    fn receive(&mut self, _ctx: &Context<Self::Msg>, _msg: Print, _sender: Sender) {
        println!("Total counter value: {}", self.count);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sys = ActorSystem::new().unwrap();

    let props = Props::new::<Counter>();
    let actor = sys.actor_of_props("counter", props).unwrap();
    actor.tell(Add, None);
    actor.tell(Add, None);
    actor.tell(Sub, None);
    actor.tell(Print, None);

    // force main to wait before exiting program
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
}
```

In this example, we've used `#actor[Add, Sub, Print]` to set up the actor to receive `Add`, `Sub` and `Print` types. For each of these, the `Receive<T>` trait is implemented on the actor, defining how each message should be handled.

!!! note
    When using the `#[actor()]` attribute, the actor's `Msg` associated type should be set to '[DataType]Msg'. E.g. if an actor is a struct named `MyActor`, then the `Actor::Msg` associated type will be `MyActorMsg`.

By utilizing `Receive<T>` and `#[actor]`, complex message handling can be defined clearly and concisely. For more advanced messaging examples see [Advanced Messaging](advanced).

In the next section, we'll explore the relationship between actors and how actors form a hierarchy.
